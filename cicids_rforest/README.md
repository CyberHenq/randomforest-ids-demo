# Detection of SSH brute-force attacks using random forest

Anybody wanting to use this repository should note that this repository was constructed as a demo for my Master's thesis.
Because of that fact this repository isn't complete enough for production use, use with your own risk. 

Note that there are two almost identical versions of the ssh_forest_experiment.py file. The main difference between the files is localization.
